			<h2>Mortality Inequality Acoss Countries With Different GDPs</h2>
			<p style="font-size:15pt">
			I completed a regression analysis on mortality inequality across different countries. In the analysis 
			I looked at changes in life expectancy over time, if there was a mortality inequality across countries 
			with different GDP per capita and if the mortality inequality has diminished over time. The data 
			consisted of observations from two different years: 1990 and 2015. With each year containing information 
			about the life expectancy at birth of each country and GDP per capita in USD. 
			
			To find out if there was as change in life expectancy, I ran a dummy regression with the life 
			expectany of 1990 and 2015 and found that there was a statisticly different change in the life expectancy. 
			To show the mortality inequality I ran two regressions, one with 1990 data and one with 2015 data.
			In the 1990 data a 1% increase in GDP was associated with a 0.05 increase in life expectancy at birth
			and a 1% increase in 2015 GDP was associated with a 0.046 increase in life expectancy. To see if the 
			mortality inequality had diminshed, I ran a regression to test the difference in slopes between the 
			1990 data and 2015 data, there was a small difference in slopes but the value was not statisticaly 
			significant, so it could not be concluded that the mortality inequality decreased.
