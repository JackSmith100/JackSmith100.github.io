			<h2>Demographic Effect on Taking Self Defense Classes </h2>
			<p style="font-size:15pt">
			Using the Canadian General Social Survey from 2014, an analysis was completed on the likelihood of people attending a 
			self defense class based on their demographics and characteristics. We found that younger women were more likely to sign up for self 
			defense classes the less safe they felt walking alone. Our evidence should be used to redirect authorities, support, and protection tools
			towards demographics that could be at risk.
			</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:15pt">
			The Canadian General Social Survey performed in 2014 was a large data set containing 33089 rows and 790 columns, the first thing 
			that had to be done was clean the data. Many of the variables in the data are categorical which bodes well to using logisitc regression. 
			Thus, a logistic regression was run with the response variable being wether the person has attended a self defense course or not, and the 
			explanatory variables are age, sex and feeling of saftey walking home. A frequentist method was adopted because GSS data is gathered 
			frequently and has large values of n, allowing us to avoid bias and identify trends in the long run.

			<h2>Concealed Carry Law Effects on Violent Crime and Murder </h2>
			<p style="font-size:15pt">
			I wrote a statisics paper thats looks for a statistically sound way to prove once and for all 
			the effect of concealed carry laws have on violent crime and murder. Multiple regressions are run to determine the effect 
			of the Shall-Carry or “concealed carry” law between the years of 1977 and 1999 in the United States. To get a complete look on 
			the picture, multiple observed variables are considered, as well as time and state effects that may have 
			unobserved effects on the regression. What is found is the concealed carry law does not seem to have a large 
			impact on the crime or murder rate in states that implement the law vs those who do not enact the law. 
			</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:15pt">
			I ran four different regressions to see how different effects and variables change the impact of the shall carry law. The data 
			was panel data, that observed multiple observations for each state between the years of 1977 to 1999.
			I ran a basic regression with just the dummy variable for the shall carry and examined the impact it had on murder and violent 
			crime rates. I then ran a second regression that controlled for other fixed effects such as the incareration rate, population density,
			avg income, population, as well as demographic variables. The third regression controlled for clustered standerd errors and state fixed 
			efects, and the foruth controlled for the variables in the third as well as time fixed effects. 
			</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:15pt">
			Clustered standard errors help the regression when there is potential serial correlation across time (i.e. the omitted errors are 
			uncorrelated across state). If there is serial corelation, then standard errors are likely to be wrong and this will affect the 
			statistical significance testing. Controlling for the state effects in the fixed effects regression removes any time invariant
			unobserved variation across states, meaning that any unobserved variation in the states that is the same across all time periods 
			will be wiped out with state fixed effects. An Example of state effect variation could be ease access to guns and 
			firearm types that can be sold, each state will have different laws on how easy it is to get a gun but should be constant across time.
			Controlling for time effects in fixed effects regression makes sure that any variation in the model that is state invariant that 
			changes across time is removed from the model. An example of a time effect could be national changing attitude toward violent crime, 
			this could be something that varies between years but not states.
			</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:15pt">
			What is found after running the regressions is that concealed carry laws have little impact on the murder rate and violent crime. 
			The first and second regression found a stong statistical significant result that the shall carry law reduced violent crime and 
			the murder rate. But, when state fixed effects, clustered standered errors and time fixed effects are controlled for there is only 
			a very small non-statistically different result in the murder/violent crime rates. Its likely that any difference veiwed in the 
			first and second regression was because the model was not refined enough and as the model get more refined the difference 
			between states with and without concelaed carry gets smaller. 
			</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:15pt">
			Once the logistic regression is run The slope parameters of the regression represent the change in log odds in the likelihood 
			someone has attended a self defense course.Analysing the results of the logistic regression estimates more closely, we can see that
			there is an increase in the likelihood of attending aself defense course if the respondent was female compared to male. There was 
			also an increase in the log odds, and therefore likelihood,for people who felt less safe walking home compared to respondents that 
			felt very safe walking home. Looking at the age group parameter estimates, the probability of attending a self defense course seems 
			to decrease with age. People in the age group of 15-24 were the most likely age group to attend a self defense course while those in 
			the age group of 75 and older had the lowest likelihood of attending a course.

			<h2>Toronto and Mississauga Housing Sale Regression Analysis</h2>
			<p style="font-size:15pt">
			I completed two analyses comparing housing sales of detached homes in Toronto and Mississauga. In the 
			analysis I did a simple random sample of the data, removed any cases that did not seem to fit the data, 
			I created graphs and tables to describe the data, analyzed correlations and ran mutliple models and then 
			tested the models to find the correct one. 
			</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:15pt">
			To test which model is the best, I completed tests using the AIC or the Akaike information criterion and the BIC aka the 
			Bayesian information criterion.

			<h2>Mortality Inequality Acoss Countries With Different GDPs</h2>
			<p style="font-size:15pt">
			I completed a regression analysis on mortality inequality across different countries. In the analysis 
			I looked at changes in life expectancy over time, if there was a mortality inequality across countries 
			with different GDP per capita and if the mortality inequality has diminished over time. The data 
			consisted of observations from two different years: 1990 and 2015. With each year containing information 
			about the life expectancy at birth of each country and GDP per capita in USD. 
			</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:15pt">
			To find out if there was as change in life expectancy, I ran a dummy regression with the life 
			expectany of 1990 and 2015 and found that there was a statisticly different change in the life expectancy. 
			To show the mortality inequality I ran two regressions, one with 1990 data and one with 2015 data.
			In the 1990 data a 1% increase in GDP was associated with a 0.05 increase in life expectancy at birth
			and a 1% increase in 2015 GDP was associated with a 0.046 increase in life expectancy. To see if the 
			mortality inequality had diminshed, I ran a regression to test the difference in slopes between the 
			1990 data and 2015 data, there was a small difference in slopes but the value was not statisticaly 
			significant, so it could not be concluded that the mortality inequality decreased.
